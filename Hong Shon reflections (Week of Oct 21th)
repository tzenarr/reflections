Hong Shon reflections (Week of Oct 21~Oct 25)


1.

As for the project that was due this week, we faced the same problem as the last time. The inner-group (vertical group) communication was proved to be a problem again. Our group members tried to solely rely on email and facebook chats as means of communication as we did last time, but again the communication was not as smooth and fast as we reckoned it to be.
We as a group seriously thought that next time we should schedule a real meeting. We should try to work with every members' schedules to find the best time. Up to now, we were too busy with our own businesses that we preferred to work at home, but not anymore.

On thursday, in class we met as horizontal groups to come up with new strategies. As presenters, we shared many food for thoughts and brainstorming, which should be helpful for everybody.

Major problem. I dropped my laptop from bunk bed and it broke beyond repair. I only have a netbook to rely on my all school work. I doubt if a mere netbook would be able to handle the programs we use for this class. I feel its necessary to visit office hour to face this technical problem.
