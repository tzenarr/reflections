Hong Shon reflections (Week of Nov 4~Nov 8)



1)

One of the major achievements we as presenters made this week was a horizontal meet-up we had on monday (nov 4th). Communication among classmates and making sure that everybody is on the same page has been emphasized enough in this class. For the upcoming project, it is important that each presenter from each group knows the whole picture and which part he or she has to contribute. 
In that sense, having a meetup altogether was exceptionally effective. Given there were some presenters who were still unaware of where they are standing, they could come to the horizontal meeting and grasp the whole idea quickly and efficiently.
I was one of those who were benefited. Thx to the meeting I could know where I (and my group) is standing. Since my group started late, my attendance to the meeting helped my group as a whole. 


2) 

For our group is made up of 4 visualizers and 1 presenter - a strictly visualizer's group - our members all have weak programming background. 
Our group member hyungkyu chang attended python workshop on 11/9 Sat. His devotion will make our group better understand programming-wise.


3)

My horizontal group is now more strongly connected to each other. Cannot wait for the next horizontal meeting where we will share all good insights and opinions!
