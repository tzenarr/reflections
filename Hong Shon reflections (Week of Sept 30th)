Hong Shon reflections (Week of Sept 30~Oct 4)


1. 

We tried some practical data mining via gathering classmates' answers from questionnaire submissions on Tuesday. 

The questionnaire contained personality check questions which showed who each of us is in terms of learning and communication processes. Based on this result, each of us was assigned to one of the different roles - curator, analyst, visualizer, and presenter.
Visual: 6
Aural: 9
Read/Write: 9
Kinesthetic: 10
My result showed that I am more of aural/kinesthetic person. I didn't think that I am strong in reading/writing, so I was a bit suspicious of the result. I was given a role of presenter, which I think suits me perfectly. I am looking forward to work with my teammates.


2. 

On Thursday, a guest speaker, Prof. Stark, came to speak about probabilities of earthquake occurrences. I was not able to understand every single thing he said, but only some of it. One thing that I remember is that earthquake probability is like a casino game. We know it'll happen, but just don't know exactly when and how big it is. 

His presentation gave me a good example of how data mining and probability models could be found useful in life-related events. I am looking forward to learn from more examples/seminars to come in this semester.
