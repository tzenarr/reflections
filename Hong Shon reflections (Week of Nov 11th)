Hong Shon reflections (Week of Nov 11~Nov 15)



1)

It sucks that I forgot to write this reflection over the break. I don't want this to become a habit so it's something to be more careful. I know it is tuesday morning that I'm writing this, and that now this is too late that I doubt anyone would read this, but I'll still write this in order to record whatever after-thoughts and insights I have gained from last week.


2)

On thursday, analyzers group members were divided to assist each visualizers group. their help was truly magnificiant; they gave us new insights, facilitated our understanding of the materials as well as helped us in connecting to other groups. 
Those analyzers also attended our vertical group meeting on saturday to help us set up new smart goals. thanks for Alisha Agrawal and Maggie Zhang!


3) i didn't expect that my individual response that was due last thursday would be replied. thank you, kristina, and aaron, for kind concerns....
