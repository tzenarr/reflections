Hong Shon reflections (Week of Oct 28~Nov 1)



1)

For this final project, I formed a new group with new members. Our group consists of 1 presenter (myself) and 4 visualizers. Apparently this makes us a good visualizers' group, I hope.

2)

A roadblock for myself. I went to LA on friday and came back on sunday evening to visit my sick father. I have been out of touch with my groupmates so I had only a little time to catch up with everybody on sunday.


3)

However, due to lack of communication within this group (newly formed for this project), by sunday evening we had not chosen a task to work on. We visited office hour together and found a task to work on. We were late on time-boundedness of smart goal. We decided to meet after office hour & on monday to better grasp what we have to do as a group.

the roadblock for our group was that we started on sunday. But, since we are visualizers we have to wait for the data to be passed by analyzers. till then, we should try hard to understand the concept behind this project.
