Hong Shon reflections (Week of Nov 25~Nov 29)


1)

It was a thanksgiving week. No class on thursday. Maybe less stuff to talk about in my reflection?


2)

still, this week was quite sensational in many ways, especially everybody's grade was announced through email. A lot of students were present on tuesday, including myself... haha.

aside from github contributions, I think grading was also heavily based on member evaluations. 

I think member evaluaations as a means of grading has its pros and cons. I think a lot of berkeley students are used to simply completing the asisngments (while often missing the lecture) and doing well on the exam.
Although this class focused on communication between members and one's role within a big picture, I think the class structure was unfamiliar to most of us. I am not saying it is good or bad, but just that it was different from what was usually expected of many of us.

I still think that the class should have had stronger rules in the first place that would more efficiently prevent students from "missing out" from lecture or class community.
This class (many students would say the same) has been in large part quite incoherent. The class aimed for something supreme, but because of that we were doing werse than usual. 

therefore, I think the class administration had its shortcomings (just like students).

we should have had stronger class disciplines in order ensure better class participation and class environment, and more organized grading scheme in the first place.

I think relying on peer review for a considerable part of our grades wasn't that "just" idea. 

we could have done better, which we will learn from this class i think.

B/B+ range isn't as bad as i expected. haha
