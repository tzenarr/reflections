Reflections for Week of Sept 23-27

1)

This week was the 4th week of this semester and the last week to freely add or drop a course. Previously I was taking Stat 158, but due to changes in personal circumstances I had to drop it look for another course in earlier time. Luckily, I was able to get into Stat 157 at the last moment, and I am very thankful to prof. Culich.

I attended my first lecture on Tuesday (24th). Everything seemed very overwhelming and I could understand near to nothing and thought it is hard to catch up a month's worth of materials. However I felt relieved when professor told me that I was not much behind as I assumed to be. 

I asked for the office hours (which were Tu/Th morning and on sunday). I was not able to attend any during this week, which was against my plan. I need to be more efficient with my schedule and will do my best to attend all office hours, and that is what I will do.


2)

As for the lecture, I was quite motivated to experience an active interaction between the instructor(s) and students in the class setting. Professor was openly asking for opinions regarding the direction of the course, and students were actvely participating. I look forward to catch up fast and take a part in the class too.

3) 

I became friends with one of the classmates in 157 (his name is hyung kyu chang) and asked some questions about this course. He told me about this reflection I'm writing. I am just writing about anything that I've felt about the course so far..

4)

Although not thoroughly, I was informed about the fact that this class has been focusing on installing virtual machine software (virtualbox?). By reading previous class notes I will try to figure out some ways to install it on my laptop, but since my laptop is just a mere NETBOOK, I doubt if this little thing is capable of running virtual machine.... more to find out.

5)

It seems that I have to find and join a group!
